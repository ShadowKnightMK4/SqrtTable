# SqrtTableGIT

To use:

SqrtTableGit is a console app writting in c# for the Windows PC.
If ran with no arguments it will output the square roots for numbers 1-1000 to the console in the below form.

N=X, N^2=Y, sqrt(N) = Z, N=X,  N^2=Y, sqrt(N) = Z N=X, N^2=Y, sqrt(N) = Z	    Where N is the number currently being used and X, Y, Z are the results of the calculations.

There are a few parameneters that will modify the program's action.

/?		                -- Gets a helpfull message writting to the console screen instead of square roots.
/C followed by a number		-- this sets how high to go in the square root calculations.


The 1st argument should be "nameoffile.txt" ect...	This names the file to place on the currently logged in user's desktop with the output instead of the console window.


After running:
	I opened the file in notepad then set the font size to 4.
Next I converted it to PDF via the 'Print to PDF' feature built into windows. 
Finally I printed the part I wanted onto 2 sides of a paper.
The result was a calculated square root table up to about 840 on a single sheet of paper.
