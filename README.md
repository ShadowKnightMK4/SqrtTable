# SqrtTableGIT

To use:

Open a console window and run SqrtTable.exe
Will output the square roots of 1-1000 in the form up

N=the number,	n *n,	sqrt(n) = the square root of the n rounded to 3 decimal places.


FLAGS:

/?	- get some more documentation

/C number	- set how high to go.

1st argument is the name of the file to write the sqrt table to on the logged in user's desktop.


After writing the sqrt table to a file open and print in notpad with a tiny font (I choose size 4) as a PDF.
Finally print PDF pages. I ended up printing double sized by just feeding the page thru again.
